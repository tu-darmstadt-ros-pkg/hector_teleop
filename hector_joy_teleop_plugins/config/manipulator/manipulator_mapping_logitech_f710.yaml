# for unknown mappings of [joystick axes or buttons] to [array index]: "sudo jstest /dev/input/jsX" (X is often 0) and then test each axis/button on gamepad

# order needs to be same as in joy message!

# WARNING: when using LT/RT the code probably needs to be adapted, since LT/RT axes are from [-1.0,1.0] with 1.0 as default value
#  (or use mapTriggerAxes(msg) to map it to [0,1] with 0.0 as default)

# NOTES:
# 1. In oder to split an axis into two partial axes or buttons write the tow names seperated with a semicolon (and no spaces!).
#     The first one belongs to the part < 0, the second one to the part > 0 (e.g. "<nameA>_inc;<nameB>_inc")
# 2. In order to combine two (partial) axes or buttons into one axis use the suffixes <name>_inc and <name>_dec (e.g. front_inc and front_dec)

axes:
  - "translate_y_inc;translate_y_dec"  # 0: left joystick: left/right
  - "translate_z_inc;translate_z_dec"  # 1: left joystick: up/down

  - "rotate_roll_inc;rotate_roll_dec"  # 3: right joystick: left/right
  - "rotate_pitch_inc;rotate_pitch_dec"  # 4: right joystick: up/down
  - "translate_x_inc"  # 5: RT
  - ""  # 6: cross: left/right
